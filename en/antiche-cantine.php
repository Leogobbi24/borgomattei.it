                                <b>Within the Tenuta Sant'Anna complex, in addition to the residential structures of Borgo Mattei, lies an extensive underground cellarâ€”a captivating artifact undergoing an ambitious restoration project initiated in late 2023.</b><br><br>
                                <b>Hypogeal Cellars:</b> Originally an ancient Roman volcanic ash quarry, the hypogeal structure was later converted into a cellar for the processing and preservation of wine produced on the agricultural estate above. At the entrance, ancient cisterns are embedded in the wall, while in front, wide alcoves are carved into the stone for the wine barrels. A staircase descends for about eight meters with lateral slides for loading, leading to a long corridor with spaces shaped like a patriarchal cross for wine storage. This hypogeal structure stands as a significant testament to the viticultural vocation of Castelli Romani, remaining intact without recent alterations. In addition to representing the continuity between past and present agricultural activities, it played a crucial role during World War II. During the bombings on Marino, the site provided refuge for citizens, as evidenced by the large dome-shaped air intakes created during that period.
